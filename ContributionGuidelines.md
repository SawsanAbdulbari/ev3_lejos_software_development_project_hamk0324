# Contribution Guidelines 🙌

This documentation contains a set of guidelines to help you during the contribution process to this project. Thank you for helping out and remember, No contribution is too small.

## Steps to Contribute👩‍💻👨‍💻

Please make sure you follow these guidelines so your code can be merged efficiently and cleanly.

## Branches 🌴

If you have an idea or a feature you would like to add to this project, make sure you create a new branch and work from there. Do not! 🛑 push from the main branch to ensure that everything stays organized.

## Making Changes ♻

- If you notice another issue aside from the one you are working on. Raise a different PR for it. 🙏🏽

- Do not delete or modify someone else's code in this repository, unless stated otherwise.🙂

- Give meaningful names to the files or folders you are adding, for the contents to be recognizable.

## Commits ✨

- Write your commit message in the imperative: "Fix bug" and not "Fixed bug" or "Fixes bug." As this style matches with commit messages generated by commands like git merge and git revert.
